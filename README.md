### Output



[^1]: A basic shape is defined so that the input reading and processing can be kept simple. This toolbox is designed to focus on the analysis and presentation of results, and not on data preparation. Currently, the PRIMAP emissions module is the primary data preparation tool, but other tools should be capable of writing this data format. For more information, please see more detailed documentation. **TODO**.
