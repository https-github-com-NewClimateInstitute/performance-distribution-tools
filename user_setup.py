# Please select country groups from this list. You can input the group itself or countries within the groups using ISO 3166 alpha-3 country codes.
# For example:
    # countries = UNFCCC (includes all countries in the UNFCCC)
    # countries = ['EGY', 'GRC', 'EUU', 'COL'] (includes Egypt, Greece, European Union, and Colombia)
    # International shipping is 'SEA'
countries = UNFCCC #['EGY', 'GRC', 'EUU', 'COL']

# Select a country to highlight as a vertical bar in the distribution (function not to be included in the website?)

# Select the year that you want to plot:

year_of_interest = '2019'

# In case of plotting difference from a baseline year, specify the baseline year here:

baseline_year = '1990'

# Select the data that you want to plot.
